## Asking Questions

### Best Practices for Questions

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific: "What is the PTO policy for US employees?" | Be vague: "Tell me about time off" |
| Ask one question at a time | Ask multiple unrelated questions |
| Provide context: "For the Q4 sales report..." | Assume the bot knows your context |
| Use natural language | Use keywords only |

### Example Questions

**HR & Benefits:**
- "How many vacation days do I get per year?"
- "What is the process for requesting parental leave?"
- "What are the health insurance options for my family?"

**IT & Technical:**
- "How do I set up VPN on my laptop?"
- "What is the process for requesting software access?"
- "How do I reset my password?"

**Policies & Procedures:**
- "What is the expense reimbursement limit for meals?"
- "What are the guidelines for remote work?"
- "How do I report a security incident?"

**Company Information:**
- "What are the core values of the company?"
- "Who is the head of the Engineering department?"
- "Where are our office locations?"

## Understanding Responses

### Citations

Every response includes citations that reference the source documents:

```
Example Response:

Full-time employees receive 20 days of paid time off (PTO) annually [Source 1].
Unused PTO can be carried over up to 5 days [Source 2].

Sources:
[Source 1] Employee Handbook > Benefits > Time Off Policy
[Source 2] HR FAQ > PTO Carryover Guidelines
```

**Always verify important information** by clicking on the source links.

### Confidence Levels

The copilot may indicate its confidence level:

| Response Type | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Direct answer with citations | High confidence - information found in documents |
| "Based on the available information..." | Medium confidence - partial match found |
| "I don't have information about..." | No matching information in knowledge base |
| "You may want to contact..." | Topic requires human assistance |

### When the Copilot Says "I Don't Know"

If you see "I don't have information about that topic," it means:
- The topic may not be in the knowledge base yet
- The question may be outside the scope of available documents
- The answer may require up-to-date information not yet indexed

**What to do:**
1. Try rephrasing your question
2. Be more specific about what you're looking for
3. Contact the relevant department directly (HR, IT, etc.)

## Follow-up Questions

You: Is there a deadline for that?
Bot: Carryover days must be used by March 31...
```
