| 13 | **SLA by Severity** | Control exposure time | Enforce fix timelines | SLA enforced | SLA policy |
| 14 | **Temporary Mitigations** | Reduce blast radius | Apply compensating controls | Approved & tracked | Mitigation record |
| 15 | **Patch Management** | Close known gaps | Apply patches systematically | No ad-hoc patching | Patch logs |
| 16 | **Verification & Retesting** | Confirm fix works | Re-scan after remediation | Must pass | Retest reports |
| 17 | **Exception / Risk Acceptance** | Controlled risk | Formal risk acceptance | Time-bound only | Risk acceptance log |
| 18 | **Production Safeguards** | Prevent exploit impact | WAF, rate limits, feature flags | Enabled where needed | Config evidence |
| 19 | **Monitoring & Alerting** | Detect exploitation | Alert on exploit attempts | Real-time alerts | SIEM rules |
| 20 | **Incident Escalation** | Rapid response | Escalate exploited vulns | IR linkage | IR tickets |
| 21 | **Reporting & Metrics** | Track posture | Dashboards & trends | KPIs reviewed | Metrics reports |
| 22 | **Audit & Compliance** | Prove control | Retain evidence | Retention enforced | Audit records |
| 23 | **Training & Awareness** | Reduce recurrence | Secure coding & vuln training | Annual training | Training logs |
| 24 | **Continuous Improvement** | Improve maturity | RCA & trend analysis | Actions tracked | Improvement backlog |
| 25 | **Governance & Review** | Enforce discipline | Periodic SOP review | Approval recorded | Review minutes |

## Severity Levels & SLAs

| Severity | Examples | SLA to Remediate |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Critical** | RCE, auth bypass, exposed secrets | 24–72 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, SQLi | ≤ 7 days |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure | ≤ 30 days |
| **Low** | Best-practice issues | ≤ 90 days |

---

## AI / GenAI Vulnerability Add-Ons

| Vulnerability Type | Description | Tracking |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| Prompt injection & jailbreak vectors | Input manipulation attacks | Like code vulns |
| Cross-tenant data leakage via RAG | Unauthorized data access | Critical |
| Excessive tool/agent permissions | Over-privileged AI agents | High |
| Model extraction & abuse patterns | IP theft, misuse | High |
| Token exhaustion / cost-based DoS | Resource abuse | Medium |

## Scan Types & Coverage

| Scan Type | When | What |
|-----------|------|------|
| **SAST** | CI/CD, PR | Source code |
| **DAST** | Staging, Prod | Running application |
| **SCA** | CI/CD, Daily | Dependencies, SBOM |
| **Container Scan** | Build, Registry | Container images |
| **IaC Scan** | CI/CD | Terraform, K8s manifests |
| **Cloud Security** | Continuous | Cloud misconfigurations |
| **Secret Scan** | CI/CD, Git hooks | Hardcoded secrets |

---

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **MTTD** | Mean Time to Detect | < 24 hours |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Remediate | Within SLA |
| **% within SLA** | Vulnerabilities fixed on time | > 95% |
| **Recurring rate** | Same vuln reintroduced | < 5% |
| **Open Critical/High** | Current exposure | 0 Critical, < 10 High |
| **AI-specific vuln count** | AI/GenAI vulnerabilities | Tracked separately |

---

## Risk Acceptance Process

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Document vulnerability and business justification |
| 2 | Identify compensating controls |
| 3 | Define time-bound acceptance period |
| 4 | Obtain risk owner approval |
| 5 | Log in risk acceptance register |
| 6 | Schedule review before expiry |
| 7 | No permanent acceptances allowed |

---

## Common Failures (Reality Check)

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Scans run but not enforced | False sense of security |
| Too many false positives, no triage | Alert fatigue |
| No ownership | No fixes |
| Risk accepted forever | Permanent exposure |
| AI vulnerabilities ignored | Novel attack vectors |
